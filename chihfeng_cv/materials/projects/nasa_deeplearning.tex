\item Established Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) model with 182 aircraft feed-in features and constructed the training workflow for multi-layer network architecture, which can be effectively applied to other prediction tasks. Succeeded in improving prediction rate by 40\% on testing data as compared with pure linear regression model. (https://goo.gl/tcTZdR)
