\item Designed ETL Process: Built a message queue system and API to digest raw data from vendor, integrated with cron jobs to automatically ship raw data to S3 data storage and a real-time error tracking system such as Sentry to improve the reliability of the process.

\item Developed Python And Scala Based Backend System: Transformed the conventional single-machine data processing system into a distributed architecture that is deployed on Amazon AWS cluster using Spark framework, which significantly reduced the computation time from 10 hours to 1 hour and converted the data into clean and structured format.

\item Bridged From Raw Data To Readily Accessible Information: Established the cron jobs that automatically ship cleaned data to the connected BigQuery database and designed all the schemas to normalize data, provided with an easy and queryable interface for data strategy team, which successfully doubled the company's productivity.

\item Managed Product And QA Environment: Utilized Docker and Vagrant to build deployment-like server environment on the local machine. Programmed Ansible playbook to automate ETL process locally and deployed code on the product server after passing testing.
