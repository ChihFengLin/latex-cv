\item Prototyped In-Car Seat Driver's Heartbeat Detection System: Developed system including hardware and software. Embedded sensor into car seat to capture vibration signal from driver and communicated digital signal with computer via Arduino. 
\item Created Heartbeat Detection Algorithm: Analyzed the extracted siganl and designed a new algorithm based on time-frequency analysis to convert vibration siganl to human readable heartbeat number. Successfully achieved error rate within 10\% as compared with ground truth.
